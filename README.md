# Domain-Oriented-Telecom-Churn-Group-Case-Study
Problem Statement:

In the dynamic telecom sector, customers wield the power to select from an array of service providers and actively transition between operators. In this fiercely competitive landscape, the telecom industry encounters an annual churn rate averaging between 15-25%. The significance of this lies in the reality that acquiring fresh customers demands 5-10 times more resources compared to retaining existing ones. As a result, the focus has pivoted toward customer retention, carrying even more weight than customer acquisition.

For established operators, the prime objective has shifted towards retaining high-value customers.

In order to curtail customer churn, telecom enterprises must forecast which customers are most susceptible to leaving.

Within this initiative, we will dissect customer-centric data from a prominent telecom entity. Our aim is to fabricate predictive models capable of identifying customers with a heightened likelihood of churn. Moreover, we will ascertain the pivotal indicators that drive this churn phenomenon.
